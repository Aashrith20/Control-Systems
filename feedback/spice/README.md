Procedure for Running SPICE Simulations:

1.The file "ee18btech11035_spice1.net" is the netlist file for the Open-loop circuit.
2.Run this file using "ngspice ee18btech11035_spice1.net" command in the terminal.This command creates "ee18btech11035_spice1.dat" file.
3.To get Magnitude vs time plot run  "ee18btech11035_spice1.py". Before running this .py file make sure that .py and .dat file are in same directory.
4.The file "ee18btech11035_spice2.net" is the netlist file for the Closed-loop circuit.
5.Run this file using "ngspice ee18btech11035_spice2.net" command in the terminal.This command creates "ee18btech11035_spice2.dat" file.
6.To get Magnitude vs time plot run  "ee18btech11035_spice2.py". Before running this .py file make sure that .py and .dat file are in same directory.
